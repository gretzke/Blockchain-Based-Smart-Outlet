\section*{Abstract}

Nowadays, electric cars are becoming an important part of the automotive industry.
The switch to an electric vehicle is often hampered by a lack of proper charging infrastructure.
City residents rarely park in front of their own home and currently there is no convenient way to charge vehicles overnight.
To present a solution to this problem, a peer-to-peer concept was developed that allows a homeowner to sell electricity to an electric car owner with the help of a smart socket.
Furthermore, a blockchain-based payment solution was developed, enabling machine to machine payments on embedded systems like a smart socket or a plug.
A smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain acts as a middleman securing the transaction.
Thus, there is no need for an external third party during the payment process.
This concept and the payment system based on it were successfully implemented on embedded devices and enable a secure exchange of electricity for monetary value.
