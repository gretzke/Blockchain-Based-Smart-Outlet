\section*{Abstract}

City residents rarely park in front of their own home.
In the future, when more and more cars on the road will be electric, charging the car might become a problem.
This bachelorâ€™s thesis develops a peer to peer concept that allows every homeowner to sell electricity with the help of a smart socket to an electric car owner without the need for a middleman.
Furthermore a payment system was developed with the aid of the blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which can run on embedded platforms like a smart socket or plug.
This concept and payment system were implemented successfully and allow a secure exchange of electricity for monetary value on embedded systems.
